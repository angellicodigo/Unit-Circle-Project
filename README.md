# Unit Circle Project
In Pre-calculus class during Covid-19, we were learning about double and half angles. I wanted to create a calculator that solves double and half angles questions, like sin(2x) = 1/2, and graph multiple solutions onto a unit circle to find any patterns. This project made me interested in the combination of mathematics and computer science.

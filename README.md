# Unit Circle Project
In Pre-calculus class during Covid-19, we were learning about double and half angles. I wanted to create a calculator that solves double and half angles questions, like sin(2x) = 1/2, and graph multiple solutions onto a unit circle to find any patterns. This project made me interested in the combination of mathematics and computer science.

# For example
**sin(2x) = 1/2**

The code produce the solutions in radians. 
```
Solutions: [0.26179938779914946, 1.3089969389957474, 3.403392041388943, 4.4505895925855405]
```

And also provides a visual that shows the solutions in degrees on the unit circle.
